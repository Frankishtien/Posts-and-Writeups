Tips for Finding HTML Injection (Based on My Discovery)

🛠️ Here’s how I found a real HTML Injection vulnerability that gets rendered inside an email:


---

✅ 1. Look for public forms
I started by testing a public form where users can submit info (like name, address, etc.).
Target: https://lnkd.in/ek_giKPJ


---

✅ 2. Submit HTML as input
I entered this into the "Full Name" field:

<h1 style="background:red;color:black;">Injected by Rima7</h1>

No filters? You're onto something.



✅ 3. Trigger the email
Once I submitted the form, I received the confirmation email.

Boom 💥 — the HTML was rendered inside the email, not escaped.


4. Bonus tip: check for phishing potential
Try this:

<a href="https://phishing.com" style="color:red;">Click here to update your account</a>

If it looks like a real internal message — that’s phishing potential!

Final Tips :
Target Any form that reflects user input
Always check email confirmations
